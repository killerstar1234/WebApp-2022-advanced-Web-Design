What I Made:
    I just made it so the admin can add people to the teacher perm
    I Made the JWT for the teacher Token

What I need to make: 
    When the Admin does make someone a teacher permision they need to get the token somehow, mabye the server does it automaticly or the person has to go to the route to get the cookie.
    When The person does have the teacher Token they need to be able to view to add there own input
    have to delte the cookie when admin deletes the person
    Have to add a admin cookie and set it manuly to the person
