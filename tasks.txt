What I Made:
    I just made it so the admin can add people to the teacher perm
    I Made the JWT for the teacher Token

What I need to make: 
    When the Admin does make someone a teacher permision they need to get the token somehow, mabye the server does it automaticly or the person has to go to the route to get the cookie.
    When The person does have the teacher Token they need to be able to view to add there own input
    have to delte the cookie when admin deletes the person
    Have to add a admin cookie and set it manuly to the person  
    


When they go to the add input route they already have a email from loging in so first check if they have a cookie of perm-token if not check there email in the database to see if they are in the perm table in the database

2nd option - make a 1 day token and make it so the server has to check if they are in the teacher table in the databse so this would be easyer for the delete token(try this first)

What I did dec 6th 
    I just finnished that the admin could delte cookies
